## Find and replace multiple pairs of occurrences

This snippet shows how you can find and replace multiple data entries at once. For example, you want to replace the text "{{datetime}}" with the current time, and "{{signature}}" with the signature. You will need a settings object. See how it is written in code:

{{< commentLink >}}

{{< codeFromFile "snippets/docs/create_footnote" "index.js" "js" "" >}}
{{< codeFromFile "snippets/docs/create_footnote" "appsscript.json" "json" "" >}}
